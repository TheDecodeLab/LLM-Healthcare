## Introduction

This repository is part of the **LLM for Healthcare Course**, which aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how large language models (LLMs) can be applied in the healthcare domain. The course covers various topics, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of LLMs in healthcare for medical students.

## Course Syllabus

The following is the course syllabus. Please note that the titles and content are subject to minor changes:
